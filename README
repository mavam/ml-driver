ML-driver
=========

The ML-driver is a proof-of-concept Linux kernel driver for the DreamCheeky USB
missile launcher. I developed it mainly to gain experience in kernel driver
hacking. Hence it is mereley a skeleton and not very sophisticated.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

    * Linux kernel version >= 2.6.17

    * GNU make

Note that I haven't tested the driver with kernel versions greater than 2.6.17.

============
Installation
============

Compilation is straigt forward:

    make

To load the module, I provide a little script:

    ./ml_manage.sh load

Check your messages afterwards. If everything went fine, you should see these
lines:

    [info]  ml_probe(593): USB missile launcher now attached to /dev/ml0
    usbcore: registered new driver missile_launcher
    [info]  usb_ml_init(651): driver registered successfully


Now you are ready to play with the tool in user-space. Simply compile the
example code in this directory:

    gcc -o ml_control user-space.c
    ./ml_control -f

Double-check the permissions of your device (/dev/ml0) when encountering any
problems.

Another workaround

If you know the product id and vendor id of usb serial device, then you can register it while insmod of usbserial driver.
e.g.
run "modprobe usbserial vendor=0x1eab product=0x0d02"

You can get the product id and vendor id by using "lsusb" command.
